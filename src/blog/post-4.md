# What Astro Taught Me

Week four of publishing with Astro felt different. Instead of chasing features, I slowed down and considered the rhythm of writing.

## Tiny loops, fast feedback

Previewing with `pnpm run dev` while editing markdown helped me see Compose → Save → Review as one tight loop. Seeing the site respond instantly made it easier to polish copy.

## Sustainable publishing

I mapped out a lightweight template for every post—opening story, learning notes, and the next step. That structure keeps me from staring at a blank editor.

## What's next

Next week I want to focus on accessibility checks before shipping new components, and explore how RSS fits into a weekly newsletter workflow.
